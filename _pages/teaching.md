I have over six years of experience delivering and supporting high-quality teaching in **robotics, control engineering, mechatronics, automation, and systems engineering** across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. My teaching emphasizes **hands-on learning, project-based instruction, and the integration of theory with real-world engineering applications**.
