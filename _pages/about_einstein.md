I am Stanley Chukwuebuka Obilikpa, a robotics researcher, lecturer, and HEA Fellow with a passion for intelligent systems, modular robotics, and automation. Over the past six years, I have engaged in teaching, research, and mentoring at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, combining practical engineering with innovative problem-solving.  

My research focuses on swarm robotics, smart systems, machine learning, and robust control. I have presented my work at top international venues, including IEEE/RSJ IROS, UK-RAS conferences, and faculty research symposia. My publications include contributions to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters and IOP SciNotes, among others.  

Beyond academia, I actively contribute to outreach and professional communities. I have served as a Social Media Ambassador for IROS 2025, inspired young people through STEM programs, and volunteered with the Royal Academy of Engineering Ingenious Award projects.  

I am committed to translating advanced engineering concepts into real-world applications, fostering creativity in students, and advancing robotics research for sustainable and impactful solutions.
