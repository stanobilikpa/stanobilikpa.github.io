## Biography

I am a robotics researcher and engineering academic with expertise in modular and swarm robotics, intelligent control, and bio-inspired systems. I recently completed my PhD in Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at the <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">University of Sheffield</span> (UK) and I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA), with over eight years of experience in university-level teaching, research, and student mentoring.

My research focuses on the design of scalable, self-configuring robotic systems, including robotic fabrics and deformable modular swarms for collective perception and manipulation. I am particularly interested in bridging control theory, distributed intelligence, and real-world robotic deployment, with applications spanning autonomous systems, sustainable automation, and future aerospace and space robotics. My work has been published in leading venues such as IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and presented at flagship conferences including IEEE/RSJ IROS (Hangzhou, China).

I have gained extensive international research experience through visiting appointments and collaborative training programmes. In 2019, I was a research scholar at the <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">Laboratory for Dynamics and Control of Nanosystems (LDCN)</span> within the Department of Systems Engineering at the <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">University of Texas at Dallas</span> (USA), where I worked on the design and implementation of robust H-infinity controllers for MEMS-based sensing and nano-positioning systems. In the same year, I also undertook a visiting research stay at the <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">Department of Biomedical Engineering, Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH)</span> (Switzerland), further strengthening my interdisciplinary background in sensing, actuation, and control.

My doctoral training has been complemented by selective international summer schools and advanced training programmes, all of which involved intensive, team-based group research projects. At the <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">IEEE RAS Summer School on Multi-Robot Systems</span> (Prague, Czech Republic), I collaborated in a multidisciplinary team to develop decentralized control strategies for UAV swarms, focusing on time-optimal navigation and dynamic obstacle avoidance. At the <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">World University Network (WUN) Doctoral Robotics Summer School</span> (York, UK), I worked within an international group to conduct a comprehensive safety and risk assessment for UAV swarm deployment in emergency firefighting scenarios. Earlier, I participated in the <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">ENHANCE / JNRSE Summer School on Energy Harvesting and Smart Systems</span> (France), engaging in collaborative projects on smart materials, energy harvesting mechanisms, and sustainable system design.

Alongside my research, I am deeply committed to engineering education, outreach, and capacity building. I have delivered and supported a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate modules in robotics, control systems, automation, and mechatronics, and I actively engage in STEM outreach and public engagement through the Royal Academy of Engineering and UK STEM networks. Through my work, I aim to advance robust, ethical, and socially responsible robotic systems while inspiring the next generation of engineers and roboticists.
