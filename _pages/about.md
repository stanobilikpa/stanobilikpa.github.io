## Biography


I am **Stanley Chukwuebuka Obilikpa**, a robotics researcher and engineering academic with expertise in **modular and swarm robotics, intelligent control, and bio-inspired systems**. I recently completed my **PhD in Automatic Control and Systems Engineering** at the **University of Sheffield**, and I am a **Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA)** with over six years of experience in university-level teaching, research, and student mentoring.

My research focuses on the design of **scalable, self-configuring robotic systems**, including *robotic fabrics* and **deformable modular swarms** for collective perception and manipulation. I am particularly interested in bridging **control theory, distributed intelligence, and real-world robotic deployment**, with applications spanning **autonomous systems, sustainable automation, and future aerospace and space robotics**. My work has been published in leading venues such as **IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)** and presented at flagship conferences including **IEEE/RSJ IROS**.

I have gained **international research experience** through several visiting and training appointments. In **2019**, I was a **research scholar at the Laboratory for Distributed Control and Networks (LDCN)** within the **Department of Systems Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas**, where I worked on **robust H-infinity control and high-precision MEMS-based sensing systems**. The same year, I also undertook a **visiting research stay at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH), Switzerland**, strengthening my interdisciplinary perspective on sensing, actuation, and control.

My doctoral training has been complemented by **selective international summer schools and advanced training programmes**. These include the **IEEE RAS Summer School on Multi-Robot Systems (Prague)**, where I developed decentralized control strategies for UAV swarms, and the **World University Network (WUN) Doctoral Robotics Summer School**, where I led a collaborative safety and risk-modelling study on the deployment of **UAV swarms for emergency firefighting**. Earlier, I participated in the **ENHANCE / JNRSE Summer School on Energy Harvesting and Smart Systems** in France, gaining strong foundations in smart materials, power electronics, and sustainable system design.

Alongside my research, I am deeply committed to **engineering education, outreach, and capacity building**. I have delivered and supported a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate modules in **robotics, control systems, automation, and mechatronics**, and I actively engage in **STEM outreach and public engagement** through the Royal Academy of Engineering and UK STEM networks. Through my work, I aim to inspire the next generation of engineers while advancing **robust, ethical, and socially responsible robotic systems**.
