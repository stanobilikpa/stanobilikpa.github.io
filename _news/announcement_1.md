I attended the **IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)** in Hangzhou, China from **19th to 25th October 2025**. During the conference, I **presented our research on scalable plug-and-play robotic fabrics based on Kilobot modules**, providing an excellent opportunity to share findings with international robotics experts and engage in collaborative discussions. I also served as a **Social Media Ambassador**, promoting conference activities and research highlights across IEEE RAS platforms.
