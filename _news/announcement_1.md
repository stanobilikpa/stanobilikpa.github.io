I attended the <a href="https://www.iros25.org/Registration" target="_blank" style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</a> in Hangzhou, China from <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">19th to 25th October 2025</span>. During the conference, I <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">presented our research on scalable plug-and-play robotic fabrics based on Kilobot modules</span>, providing an excellent opportunity to share findings with international robotics experts and engage in collaborative discussions. I also served as a <span style="color:var(--global-theme-color);">Social Media Ambassador</span>, promoting conference activities and research highlights across IEEE RAS platforms.
