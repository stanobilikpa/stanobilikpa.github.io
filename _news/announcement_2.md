I successfully **defended my PhD thesis** in Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at the **University of Sheffield** on **1st December 2025**. My research focused on **modular swarm robotics, intelligent control, and scalable robotic systems**. This milestone marks the completion of a rigorous research journey involving experimental work, simulations, and publication in top-tier venues such as **IEEE RA-L**.
